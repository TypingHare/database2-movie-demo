## Clone This Repository

In Git, **cloning a repository** means downloading a repository from a remote Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub) to your computer. On your computer, a directory that contains a hidden `.git` folder is called a **local repository**. To clone a repository to your computer, follow these steps:

1. Download `Git` from the official website (GPTs can help you with that).
2. Open `GitBash` on Windows 11 or `Terminal` on Unix systems (macOS and Linux).
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TypingHare/database2-movie-demo
   ```
4. This will download the repository from GitHub to your computer, and the folder is in the present working directory.

## Update Local Repository

I may update this repository from time to time. To keep your local repository up to date, you need to run the following command in your local repository (that is, when the **present working directory** is the project’s root directory):

```bash
git pull
```
